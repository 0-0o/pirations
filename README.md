broken as shit rn they basically changed the whole thing so imma need to do a load of rewriting.
looks like they dont even use embed.su/api/e/{hash} anymore (they changed domain name from vidsrc.pro to embed.su)
maybe could see if this method still works somehow who fucking knows

update: they use embed.su/api/e/{hash} for some movies/shows but not all, not sure what to think of this tbh
